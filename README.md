# ical2json-api


ical is a scray format and if you want to include e.g. a calendar in your website, handling something like json is much
easiert in a few lines of JS. Therefore I started this middleware that takes an iCal URL and offers an http endpoint
where the upcomming events get served as a json file.

This is currently a **VERY** early PoC hacked together in a few hours with hardcoded values and not that much error
handling. Use at your own risk!
